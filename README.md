## Liability and Honor Code
I am NOT responsible for your grade or any Honor Code Violation. I only place my code on GitHub so I can sync between computers and use version control. This repository was kept private until final grades were submitted to prevent violations and cheating, but was then publicized to display my coding abilities for job interviews and related such. Use at your own risk. ([Such paraghph quoted form aryan-gupta](https://github.com/aryan-gupta))
